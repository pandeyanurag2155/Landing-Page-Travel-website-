        <hr>
        <p class="review">Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love being outside with my friends. After going on one of these tours, I can safely say that beer pong is my favorite game all time, also the cultural programs were really interesting!</p>
        <p class="author">-Anurag Pandey </p>
        <p class="review">The destinations were breathtaking and unique, taking us off the beaten path and allowing us to explore hidden gems we wouldn't have found on our own. The guides were knowledgeable, friendly, and made sure we had a fantastic time throughout the journey.</p>
        <p class="author">-Amrit </p>
        <p class="review">If you want to understand your friends better, head to the mountains. I mean, seriously. It's like sitting next to a campfire and just talk in the sunset, woah. You know? It's like that.</p>
